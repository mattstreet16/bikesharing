# Bikesharing


## Overview
The objective of this project is to use visualizations of NYC Citi Bike data to convince investors to help fund a Bikesharing business of my own in Des Moines. By downloading the Citi Bike data, analyzing the information, and creating multiple visualizations in Tableau, my team of investors will see the opportunity at hand and help fund my bikesharing dreams.


## Results 
I created a Tableau Story to display my analysis and visualizations

## Summary
In summation, Checkout time for users and checkout time by gender graphs show that the bike sharing service is mainly used in minutes rather than hours and that men use the service far more than any other gender. The trips by weekday and by gender visualizations show that the most active hours of rentals are between 7 am and 7 pm. The Weekday user type visualizations show that a very large percentage of users are subscribers rather than one-time customers. Lastly, the Start and End point visualizations show the most popular areas of rentals and their relation with tourist attractions. Ultimately loads more graphs and visualizations could further prove that Des Moines' very own bikesharing business could thrive.
